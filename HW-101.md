# CargoX: Fintech in Supply Chain

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

 CargoX 

* When was the company incorporated? 

Aug 2017

* Who are the founders of the company? 

Stefan Kukman

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

 The founder, Stefan Kukman, puts it succinctly when he says “Technology companies often lack the shipping and logistics expertise necessary to break into this industry. On the other hand, logistics companies venturing into the tech field may be held back by their reliance on established, old-school business practices.”¹ CargoX is mixing Blockchain and transportation to remove efficiencies and save money for its customers.

* How is the company funded?

 How much funding have they received? Funded through an ICO, an “Initial Coin Offering”. ICO’s exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat from “investors”. Now understood to be very risky, ICO’s were common from 2013 - 2017. Not all companies who raised their initial funds through ICO’s are failed, but most did. ¹ They raised $7M in 7 minutes : 40 seconds via their ICO and that is the only sum raised at this moment.²

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

CargoX creates smart contract BOL’s which speed up and digitize the transfer of assets in a supply chain.  A BOL (Bill of Lading) is a legal/operational document that represents the physical transfer of assets in a supply chain. As an example, a shipper of towels in China would produce the BOL for the shipment. This BOL contains information about the shipment, and its owner is legally responsible for this shipment. As the BOL goes from ship to truck to warehouse, etc. the BOL is exchanged, and its successful exchange initiates financial transactions  These confirmations are directly related to payment within the supply chain.  Unfortunately paper BOL’s are costly to produce, easily destroyed, and often manipulated. In addition a large number of parties require information extracted from the BOL. These speed bumps incur financial burden and excessive wait time on the supply chain. 


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

CargoX’s current target market includes participants of the maritime supply chain in Asia and Europe. Producers of cargo, haulers of cargo, receivers of cargo and the accompanying software vendors all must be connected to CargoX’s BOL, or atleast must honour its function. As such Cargox’s customers include freight brokers (DexFreight,TPG Logistics), transportation software (RoadLaunch, Actual) and carriers (OceanX, ConsolFreight) to name a few. Supply chain software and tech spend in the U.S. alone is 87.8 Bn .¹ CargoX estimated they could save the logistics industry $5bn per year. ²

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

As it stands, the competition is composed of legacy products, current BOL’s are produced on paper and copies are notated and passed along physically or via email. Another more dire competitor would be IBM TradeLens or VeChain. Both enterprise Blockchain platforms of larger scale and funding (VeChain works with Walmart in China)¹. While CargoX is specialized with BOL’s, these other Blockchain based supply chain platforms offer a similar digital BOL in the larger landscape of their offerings. Using CargoX BOL’s, not only can information be passed digitally, but also transactions of Ethereum (and then fiat payment) can be executed and confirmed with CargoX.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

According to the CargoX website, their platform, named BDTS (Blockchain Document Transaction System) is built to; interact with customer’s API’s, secure data, easy to use browser based Dapp (Decentralized Application) creates ethereum backed tokenized BOL’s.² ERC20 tokens represent the BOL transactions while in the CargoX system, an ERC20 token is pushed around with minimal amount of gas (unit of work for Ethereum miners) and can be developed for individualized Ethereum based enterprise. ¹ Per Nick Szabo, an authority on smart contracts,”... smart contracts are the digital digital POS (Point of Sale) mechanisms”.³  Smart contracts provide an alternative to traditional escrow services and in theory produce reduced fees and secure transactions. Smart Contracts automate transactions with the accuracy of a computer, executing in seconds and are an alternative to traditional escrow services.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Blockchain and Enterprise. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Brand new startups taking advantage of the technical, financial, and cultural phenomenon that is Bitcoin. Inspired by a mix of libertarian monetary policy and revolutions in fintech, Bitcoin aimed to cut out banks and create a digital currency (cryptocurrency) which cannot be altered by the government or bad actors. While Bitcoin’s first official whitepaper was written in 2008, the cryptocurrency began to gain substantial value in 2013¹. Simultaneously other Blockchain based currencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple gained traction until arguably the height of cryptocurrency popularity in 2017.  Most enterprises in the beginning of the revolution (and currently still) found a best use case in gambling with cryptocurrencies or market- like trading of cryptocurrencies. Examples being Coinbase, Bovada, and Robinhood which all encourage the use of cryptocurrency in their platform. While the hype based bubble surrounding Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has burst, enterprise use of the value that Blockchain provides is still continuing. Especially in supply chain, finance, and government regulatory tech.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Coinbase, Bakkt, Lolli, Gemini, Binance, and Bethereum to name a few. 


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

I was not able to find revenue or profit numbers for CargoX, however as a startup their business partners are numerous since their first BOL was issued in July 2018. “ The first public blockchain (Ethereum) Bill of Lading provider approved by the International Group of P&I Clubs”. These clubs provide majority of the liability coverage for all ocean going shipments. BOL’s are key in legal disputes and this endorsement is significant.¹ Additionally in December 2019 CargoX acquired a customer, TransAuriga, who is offering the CargoX BOL to their customers. ²

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

The Blockchain enterprise domain is especially new and changing, however some important metrics include; User adoption, alignment with customer’s goals, performance against the status quo, and mining the data available¹. CargoX seems to have high user adoption considering the amount of partners currently and the industry's starvation for digital solutions give high incentive for adoption. Alignment with customer’s KPI’s and performance against the status quo have yet to be seen. But this is a problem across the entire domain, there are truly few profitable Blockchain based enterprise and much is needed to be done to mature. As far as CargoX’s ability to mine data, their current volume of customers (CargoX is a startup acquiring Pilot partners currently), likely doesn’t give them the volume of data needed for successful sales.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

While also difficult to say, a bevy of Blockchain based solution’s providers in the Supply Chain Fintech space. IBM’s TransLens, FR8 Network, ShipChain, Ripe.io, HERC, and DexFreight all offer digital BOL’s as a part of other transportation based services. This is good for CargoX who can easily pivot to building products on top of their networks, functioning as a Dapp. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

CargoX could partner with retailers and allow the transportation supply chain to use cryptocurrency to pair for repairs, food services, anything that shippers purchase with fiat.  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

It could incentivize use of the BOL by shippers and pass CargoX’s ERC20 around the ecosystem, proving trust in cryptocurrency as a stable form of payment and useful. Currently the largest need of CargoX. ¹

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

For merchants to accept cryptocurrency, services that on board fiat to cryptocurrency, and back, a velocity of transaction acceptable to merchants is required.  Something like Square is working on now.¹ A part of this solution would likely involve Stable coins (coins pegged to the price of fiat) which can assure that the customer doesn’t lose the value of the money which the customer inputs.²

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Cryptocurrency adoption depends on adoption from all verticals. In order to work in a supply chain, and indeed as a part of consumers lives, the more merchants and participants the better.
